In chapters 15-21 you will be learning about how to create and work with sprites and detect collisions. You will work through each chapter and build on the BB8 Attack Starter Code. When you are finished you will start working on your own game which you will continually upgrade. The files in this repository will be used through chapter 21. At the conclusion of chapter 21 you will finalize and submit your Sprite Game. You will then work on an Escape Room game.
